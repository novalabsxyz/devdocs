# Introduction to Helium Devices



![](../.gitbook/assets/artboard-copy-26.jpg)

The Helium Network was built to transfer device data. Here you will learn about the pieces that make up a Helium device and how you can quickly get started! Any device can communicate on the Helium network if it uses the [LoRaWAN wireless protocol](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan).

### Adding New Devices

If you're ready to add your LoRaWAN devices to the Helium Network, head over the [Co](../console/quickstart.md)[sole Quickstart](../console/quickstart.md).

We also have a growing list of sensors we've[ pre-certified and documented on the Helium Network](lorawan-devices/) for your convenience.

### Prototyping a New Device

The easiest way to prototype a new connected device for the Helium Network is to use the [LongFi Arduino library.](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino) 

And we have a complete [LongFi Arduino Quickstart Guide](arduino-quickstart.md) that walks you through the simple setup and deployment process.

### Migrating Devices to the Helium Network

Do you have devices deployed on another network like TTN, Senet, or MachineQ? Great. We have you covered. Head over to our [Device Migration Guides.](migrating-devices-to-helium/)
