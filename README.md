### Welcome to the Helium Network

The Helium Network is the largest, public LPWAN in the United States, and enables long range, low power, bi-directional communication for any LoRaWAN compatible device. 

The Helium Network is open and permissionless, and requires no up-front payments, contracts or commitments to use. Devices pay Helium Hotspot owners and other Helium Network Operators on a per-packet basis for delivering their sensors packets to the application end point. 

In this developer documentation you will find examples, tutorials, specifications, and API references for building devices to run on the Helium network.

[Console](console/introduction.md) is Helium's web-based interface for deploying and managing devices; and building flexible application-level logic into your IoT deployments.

At its core, the Helium Network exists to route data for LoRaWAN-enabled devices. Whether you're building a weather station from scratch or have a pre-built location tracker from a vendor of your choosing, we're ready for you. [Head to the Devices overview to get started.](devices/introduction.md) 

## ![](.gitbook/assets/group-18-copy-3.png) Blockchain

The [Helium blockchain](blockchain/blockchain-primitives.md) is what sets the Helium Network apart from other network providers. For developers, it means you can take advantage of one, unified feature set wherever Helium coverage exists. No roaming or brokering of packets required. Send data and the Network takes care of the rest.

The Helium Hotspot is the combination LoRaWAN router and Helium blockchain miner. There are [thousands deployed in the United States](http://network.helium.com/) \(and soon across the world\).  If you don't have one, you can [buy one here](https://www.helium.com/store). And if you want to build your own, [you absolutely should](hotspot/developer-setup.md).

The [LongFi architecture](longfi/introduction.md) combines the Helium blockchain with the LoRaWAN wireless protocol. It's an entirely unique architecture that enables developers to take advantage of better Network coverage faster.
