# Helium Devices 

The Helium Network was built to transfer device data. Here you will learn about the pieces that make up a Helium device and how you can quickly get started! 

Any device can communicate on the Helium network if it uses the <a href="https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan" target="_blank">LoRaWAN wireless protocol</a>.  

## Registering New Devices 

For information on how to add new LoRaWAN devices, visit the [Console Quickstart](/console/quickstart).

### Developing A New Device

#### LongFi Arduino
The LongFi Arduino repository provides example Sketches that help LoRaWAN capable Arduino devices connect to the Helium Network.

## Migrating Devices 
If you already have LoRaWAN devices deployed on another network and would like to migrate your devices, you can easily do so by updating the device's DevEUI/AppEUI/AppKey.
