## Helium Hotspot

The Helium Hotspot is a combination [LongFi](../longfi/introduction.md) wireless router and Helium [Blockchain](../blockchain/introduction.md) miner built and distributed by Helium, Inc. It creates a long-range network for routing packets from Helium LongFi-enabled devices and performs ongoing mining duties to secure the Helium Network. The "Helium Hotspot" is the name of the Hotspot designed, manufactured, and distributed by Helium, Inc. Developers can use the information provided here to build other "Hotspot" variants that conform to the published network specifications.

## Developer Hotspot

The [Helium Developer Hotspot](../hotspot/developer-setup.md) is a Hotspot that can be built using off-the-shelf components that is capable of sending and receiving packets over the LongFi wireless network.

Currently these Developer Hotspots cannot perform any blockchain mining functions, but this functionality is intended to be available by Q3 2020.
